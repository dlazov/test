Given the rise in assumptions and the best in practices of things that are not always seen nor at hand, your body language may give you a some what occult like and symbolic meaning that is not exactly all that was intened it to be, regardless of what you may be thinking there are other things that are more relevant and often times lounder than any blessings or curses. Some days and in some ways the expelling of your breath may cause you to loose things you thought you ought not to had nor even knew existed in this life or the next.

Yet about three years ago one man was sitting quitely along a vacant hill with nothing to do but ponder his journey and at times he seemed confused aobut the right thing to do but he carried on and left his lot in life to an idea that had been shifting around in his mind, the smarter of which was not left without reason, nor could it ever be known.

Alas, farewell, fond ado, best regards and till we meet again...
